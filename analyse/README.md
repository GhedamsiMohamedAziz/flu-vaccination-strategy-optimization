üè• Flu Vaccination Strategy Optimization

This repository provides a complete analytical framework designed to predict flu vaccine demand and improve access to healthcare across France. By combining multiple open datasets related to vaccination coverage, emergency visits, and public health campaigns, the project enables precise modeling of seasonal vaccination behavior and epidemic trends. The goal is to help decision-makers allocate resources efficiently and identify regions with low coverage rates.

The repository includes a fully documented workflow with ready-to-run Python scripts, preprocessing and feature engineering guides, and visual outputs for key indicators. The main script, flu_vaccination_analysis.ipynb, performs complete data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, producing integrated datasets and insightful charts. Complementary documentation files explain each dataset, outline integration strategies, and provide reference material for advanced analysis and model building.
This project demonstrates how open health data can be leveraged to support data-driven decisions in public health management. It offers a robust base for further work in predictive analytics, regional policy optimization, and epidemiological forecasting. Researchers, analysts, and data scientists can use it to explore correlations between vaccination activity and emergency care demand, build forecasting models, or design visual dashboards for healthcare authorities.
